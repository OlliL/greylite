COMPILING

You can compile two more modules along with greylite: dnsblenv and
ucspi2socket.

1. If you use BSDmake instead of GNUmake, rename Makefile.bsdmake to Makefile
first

2. compile and install with
$ make <arguments> install

Arguments is a list of zero of more of the following:
WITH_GEOIP=yes
    To compile greylite with support for GeoIP suspicion rules. The GeoIP
    API and library must be installed on the system

WITH_UCSPI2SOCKET=yes
    To compile the "ucspi2socket" module along with greylite.

WITH_DNSBLENV=yes
    To compile the "dnsblenv" module along with greylite. This module requires
    the c-ares library on the system.

WITH_CARES14=yes
    The dnsblenv by default looks for c-ares version 1.5, whose API is
    incompatible with version 1.4 (still widespread). If c-ares 1.4 is present
    on the system use this argument.
