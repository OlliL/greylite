.Sh NAME
.Nm greylite
.Nd transparent greylisting module for mailservers
.\"
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm greylite
.Op Ar smtpd-child
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an implementation of a modified greylisting technology for fighting SPAM on
mailservers. It combines natively with qmail and works as a proxy for any SMTP
server.
.Pp
The prevalent reference for
.Nm
is the web page at
.Ar http://mij.oltrelinux.com/net/greylite/ ;
this man page is a shorter reference.
.Pp
This man page explains how to setup and use
.Nm ,
not how to install it, nor its internals, nor its distinguishable features.
.Pp
For setup instructions, see
.Nm SETUP
below. For a quick reference on control variables, see
.Nm CONTROLS
below. For an outline of the algorithm with which greylist modified the
delivery attempts, see
.Nm ALGORITHM
below.
.\"
.\"
.Sh SETUP
Both when running as a reverse SMTP proxy or a UCSPI wrapper,
.Nm
is run under
.Ar tcpserver
(see http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/tcpserver.html).
.Pp
The database file must be created first in either case, with the file
greydb.sql from the greylite's package (installing from package managers could
already provide this database):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mkdir -p /var/db/greylite
sqlite3 -init greydb.sql /var/db/greylite/greylite.db
.Ed
.Pp
Thereafter greylite can immediately be run from a tcpserver instance, either
as proxy or as wrapper.
.Pp
When run as a reverse SMTP proxy, greylite stays in the middle of the
connection between the client and the upstream server, supervises the envelope
session transparently and decides how to act depending on its modified
greylisting algorithm. In this case, the
.Ar ucspi2socket
module is used to communicate with the upstream server:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -R -l `uname -n` BINDADDR BINDPORT \\
    env GREYLIST="" /usr/local/bin/greylite \\
    /usr/local/bin/ucspi2socket SRVADDR [SRVPORT]
.Ed
replace BINDADDR and BINDPORT with the IP address and port that greylite must
listen; replace SRVADDR (and SRVPORT if you need it) with the IP address and
port of the upstream "true" SMTP server to defend.
.Pp
When run as a UCSPI (notably, qmail) wrapper,
.Nm
is just plugged into the top of the tcpserver chain preceding qmail-smtpd. A
typical chain (as taken from
.Ar http://lifewithqmail.org/lwq.html#supervise-tree )
modified to enable greylite looks like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -R -l "$LOCAL" \\
    -x /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb -c "$MAXSMTPD" \\
    -u "$QMAILDUID" -g "$NOFILESGID" 0 smtp \\
    /usr/local/bin/greylite /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd 2>&1
.Ed
where the greylite executable is evidently inserted without further
complications. 
.Pp
Unless the 
.Ar GREYLIST
environment variable in detected by greylite, it passes transparently to the
upstream server. This variable - as well as other control variables, possibly -
can be passed with the tcpserver's control access feature (-x file option).
Based on a rule file, it can both allow/deny connections and specify
environment variables per-source-address. A rule file allowing everyone in and
passing the GREYLIST variable looks like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
:allow,GREYLIST=""
.Ed
See
.Ar http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/tcpserver.html
and
.Ar http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/tcprules.html
for more information.
.Pp
If greylite runs as unprivileged user (-u and/or -g arguments to tcpserver),
make sure that the directory holding the .db file is writable by such user.
Using custom paths or filenames for this database is also possible (see
.Nm CONTROLS
below).
.\"
.\"
.Sh CONTROLS
.Nm
is controlled exclusively by environment variables. No command line options
are required nor allowed.
.Pp
.Nm
recognizes the following environment variables:
.Bl -tag -compact
.It GREYLIST
if not set, greylisting is disabled and control is passed immediately to the
smtpd transparently. If set, greylisting mediation is enabled. Besides
existence, the value assigned to this variable is completely ignored.
.It DBFILE
if set, its value indicates the full path to the database file to use. If not
set, the default filename
.Pa /var/db/greylite/greylite.db
is used.
.It LOGTHRESHOLD
if set to an integer between 0 (LOG_EMERG) and 7 (LOG_DEBUG), log messages
with priority strictly lower than this value are not reported. Otherwise, the
default threshold is 3 (LOG_ERR).
.It LOGPID
if set, every log message will be prepended by the PID of the process writing
it.
.It SUSPICION
if set, its value indicates the full path to the suspicion file. See
.Nm SUSPICION
below.
.It GEOIPDB_FILE
when using suspicion with GeoIP rules, the value of this variable is the full
path and filename of the GeoIP database. If not set, greylite will look for
.Ar /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat .
.It GREETDELAY
when set, greylite opens the connection immediately but introduces a small
delay (by default 6 seconds) before actually responding data to the client. If
its value is a positive integer, it represents a custom delay to wait, in
millisecs.
.El
.\"
.\"
.Sh SUSPICION
Greylisting has a tremendous effectiveness and efficiency but can be easily
worked around, for example issuing the delivery twice (or thrice) in case of
temporary error.
.Pp
However, it can be frequently inferred with some accuracy that a client is
a spammer by a bunch of factors. For example, if the address' hostname
contains "ppp", or "dynamic" it is likely to be spammer; if it attempts
twice immediately, if it is located in countries like Russia or China or
Malaysia etc, if it connects and pushes data without waiting the server
responses et cetera, these are all distinguishable properties of spammers.
.Pp
"Suspicion" is a technique used by greylite to avoid the workarounds that
spammers use against greylisting. It is a list of rules to determine if the
client has to be required multiple delivery attempts (instead of the usual
double attempt): the more suspicious is a client, the more times it might be
temporarily rejected. Also, clients resulting suspicious are not whitelisted
even if they pass the greylisting challenge.
.Pp
A complete reference for greylite's suspicion is available in
.Ar http://mij.oltrelinux.com/net/greylite/suspicion.html .
.Pp
This suspicion policy is contained in a
.Ar suspicion file .
In this text file, each line has format "number letter rule" (or "number
letter ! rule"), where:
.Bl -tag -compact -offset indent
.It number
is a positive integer value defining the number of delivery attempts to
require for the message if the rule matches
.It letter
is a lowercase letter specifying the type of the rule following (see below)
.It !
if present, inverts (negates) the specification of the rule -- that is,
matches when the rule does not and vice-versa
.It rule
is the rule specification
.El
Lines whose first character is '#' are ignored. The first line whose rule
matches decides the number of attempts to require.
.Pp
The following kinds of rules are currently supported:
.Bl -tag -compact -offset indent
.It r
Reverse lookup. The rule is an extended regular expression (see re_format(7))
to check the PTR domain of the client address. If the regex matches the PTR
domain, the rule is applied. This kind of rule requires tcpserver to be run
with the
.Ar -r
command line option so that the remote host name is available to greylite.
.It v
environment Variable. The rule is a space-separated list of one or more
environment variables. If any of these variables is present in the process'
environment, the rule is applied. If the value of the variable is a positive
integer, that will be used as number of attempts instead of the number in
the rule.
.It e
Envelope analysis. The rule is a list of one or more patterns to match against
parts of the envelope information. Patterns are expressed as regular
expressions (see re_format(7)) prefixed by "r:", "s:" or "h:" for matching
respectively the envelope recipient, the envelope sender or the hostname sent
in the HELO/EHLO command.
.It g
GeoIP. The rule is a space-separated list of one or more country codes, see
.Ar http://www.maxmind.com/app/iso3166 .
If the client appears to come from a zone in this list, the rule is applied.
This kind requires greylite to be compiled with "-DWITH_GEOIP", and that the
GeoIP library and database are present in the system (see GEOIPDB_FILE in
.Nm CONTROLS
above).
.It b
client Behaviour. If the client features certain behaviours, the rule is
applied. Behaviours are specified as list of one or more keywords:
"greetdelay" (a delay is inserted before passing data when the connection is
open. Mass mailers may give up and disconnect, or send data blindly before
expecting the server's greeting. In the second case the rule matches.);
"retryinterval" (the client may be retrying deliveries of the message with an
excessive frequency that is not proper of legitimate servers.); "commanderrors"
(the client issued a command that the server did not accept during the command
session. Use with caution)
.El
Lines with an unknown kind are ignored. Lines with an incorrect format are
discarded.
.Pp
This is an example:
.Bd -literal
# unprotecteddomain.com is not protected with greylisting, and GMX is
# trusted because of SPF's "-all"
0 e r:@unprotecteddomain.com$ s:@gmx.(de|net)$
# who fails the greetdelay trap or retries blindly is rejected to the infinite
100 b greetdelay retryinterval
# dnsblenv sets the BLACKLISTED variable when the client is on a RBL
6 v BLACKLISTED
# clients outside this zone are suspicious (this is very case-specific)
3 g ! AT BE CH DE ES EU FI FR GB IT MC NO SM VA
# clients whose PTR name contains "dynamic" stuff are suspicious
3 r (^|[^a-z])(a?dsl|dyn(amic)?(ip)?|dial(in|up)?|ppp|customer|user|host|home)([^a-z]|\.?$)
2 r (([0-9]{1,3}[-.]){3})[0-9]{1,3}

.Sh MODULES
Greylite can be interfaced with more modules. Pre-modules are run before
greylite and can perform custom checks on the client and set environment
variables to which greylite can be made sensible for suspicion. Post-modules
are run after greylite and can make greylite communicate with backend servers.
Every module must conform to the UCSPI interface to be compatible with the
rest of the "service chain".
.Pp
Two modules are included in the distribution: dnsblenv and ucspi2socket.
.Pp
.Ar dnsblenv
is a pre-module. It queries a list of RBL/DNSBL lists (space-separated into
the DNSBL environment variable) for the client's address. If it is found in
any of them, it sets the BLACKLISTED environment variable and runs its
argument.
.Pp
.Ar ucspi2socket
is a post-module. It is run conforming to the UCSPI interface for interfacing
with an upstream TCP server.
.Pp
This is an example combining both modules: dnsblenv polling lists
zen.spamhaus.org and dnsbl.sorbs.net; ucspi2socket connecting to the upstream
server 1.2.3.4 on port 43210:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -R -l `uname -n` BINDADDR BINDPORT \\\\
    env GREYLIST="" DNSBL="zen.spamhaus.org dnsbl.sorbs.net" \\\\
    /usr/local/bin/dnsblenv /usr/local/bin/greylite \\\\
    /usr/local/bin/ucspi2socket 1.2.3.4 43210
